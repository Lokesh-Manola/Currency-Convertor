# Currency-Convertor
This is my another mini project using java and Swing frame work. 
  Basically, this project converts one currency into another currency .For example, we want to convert US dollar to Indian rupee , this project is able to do this as first they convert us dollar to Sterling pound and then into Indian Rupee.
